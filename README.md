# Ransomware Protection System
## About
Ransomware is malicious code that encrypts a company's data or blocks the victim's computer, only to demand payment of a ransom to release the data held hostage. To protect companies, and especially small businesses (doctors' practices, law firms, etc.), from this threat, it would be ideal to offer an effective, easy-to-implement solution.

## Objective 
To create an automatic solution to protect against ransomware.  This could involve the design and implementation of an easy-to-use anti-ransomware appliance, effective in the fight against this malicious code.

## The need
In the current context of soaring cyber-attacks, businesses - especially small ones such as medical practices or law firms - have a crucial need for ransomware protection software. Ransomware is a serious threat that can lead to devastating consequences, from the loss of valuable data to major operational disruptions. Yet many small businesses don't always have the resources to implement sophisticated security measures. That's why it's vital to offer an effective protection solution that's easy to implement. Ransomware protection software tailored to small businesses should offer features such as early threat detection, attack prevention, automatic data backup and a user-friendly interface. Enabling small businesses to protect themselves effectively against ransomware gives them the peace of mind they need to concentrate on their core business, safe in the knowledge that their data and reputation are secure.
